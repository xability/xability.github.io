The symbol "(x)" in our lab's name is an experience variable and the testament to our multifaceted approach towards inclusivity and accessibility:

- **(use)ability** emphasizes our dedication to improving usability (UX), making sure that products and services are user-friendly and accessible to people with varying needs.
- **(learn)ability** signifies our commitment to enhancing learnability (LX), ensuring educational content and experiences are accessible and engaging for everyone.
- **(access)ability** combines our efforts in UX and LX to promote accessibility, guaranteeing that information systems are within reach of everyone, irrespective of their abilities.

By focusing on **(x)Ability** rather than **(dis)Ability**, we aim to unlock each person's unlimited potential. Our lab is driven by the principle of designing with, by, for, and of people with (dis)Abilities. We strive to remove the "(x)"—the barriers—from people with (dis)Abilities, facilitating their access to information systems and contributing to a more inclusive world.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to advance the field of inclusive **UX** and **LX** design by:
- Conducting groundbreaking research that addresses the challenges faced by people with (dis)Abilities.
- Developing tools and methods that enhance the accessibility of digital environments.
- Collaborating with communities to ensure our solutions are informed by the real needs and experiences of people with (dis)Abilities.

**Join us in redefining accessibility and inclusivity at the (x)Ability Design Lab. Because everyone deserves to experience the world without barriers.**
