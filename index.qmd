Welcome to the **(x)Ability Design Lab**, pronounced as "Accessibility Design" Lab, where the "x" embodies our mission to enhance user experience (UX) and learning experience (LX) by dismantling sociotechnical barriers associated with disability. At our core, we believe in focusing on the ability and experience of all individuals, moving beyond the constraints of traditional accessibility discourse.
