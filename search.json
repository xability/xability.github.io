At our core, we believe in focusing on the ability and experience of all individuals, moving beyond the constraints of traditional accessibility discourse.\nThe symbol “(x)” in our lab’s name is an experience variable and the testament to our multifaceted approach towards inclusivity and accessibility:\nBy focusing on (x)Ability rather than (dis)Ability, we aim to unlock each person’s unlimited potential. Our lab is driven by the principle of designing with, by, for, and of people with (dis)Abilities. We strive to remove the “(x)”—the barriers—from people with (dis)Abilities, facilitating their access to information systems and contributing to a more inclusive world."
