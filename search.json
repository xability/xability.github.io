    "text": "Welcome to the (x)Ability Design Lab, pronounced as “Accessibility Design” Lab, where the “x” embodies our mission to enhance user experience (UX) and learning experience (LX) by dismantling sociotechnical barriers associated with disability. At our core, we believe in focusing on the ability and experience of all individuals, moving beyond the constraints of traditional accessibility discourse.\nThe symbol “(x)” in our lab’s name is an experience variable and the testament to our multifaceted approach towards inclusivity and accessibility:\nBy focusing on (x)Ability rather than (dis)Ability, we aim to unlock each person’s unlimited potential. Our lab is driven by the principle of designing with, by, for, and of people with (dis)Abilities. We strive to remove the “(x)”—the barriers—from people with (dis)Abilities, facilitating their access to information systems and contributing to a more inclusive world.\nJoin us in our journey to explore, innovate, and transform the landscape of accessibility and inclusive design. Together, we can create experiences that empower everyone to achieve their fullest potential."
