Some of the randomly selected sets of 5 participants found 99\% of the problems; other sets found only 55\%. With 10 users, the lowest percentage of problems revealed by any one set was increased to 80\%, and with 20 users, to 95\%.},

Our shared journey is portrayed through examples drawn from our interaction with GitHub issues, pull requests, review processes, and insider's releases, each contributing to an improved VSCode experience for blind developers. One key milestone of our co-design process is the establishment of an accessible terminal buffer, a significant enhancement for blind developers using VSCode. Other innovative outcomes include Git Diff audio cues, adaptable verbosity settings, intuitive help menus, and a targeted accessibility testing initiative. These tailored improvements not only uplift the accessibility standards of VSCode but also provide a valuable blueprint for open-source developers at large. Through our shared dedication to promoting inclusivity in software development, we aim for the strategies and successes shared in this paper to inspire and guide the open-source community towards crafting more accessible software environments.},

  abstract = {While recent years have seen a growing interest in accessible visualization tools and techniques for blind people, little attention is paid to the learning opportunities and teaching strategies of data science and visualization tailored for blind individuals. Whereas the former focuses on the accessibility and usability issues of data visualization tools, the latter is concerned with the learnability of concepts and skills for data science and visualization. In this paper, we present novel approaches to teaching data science and visualization to blind students in an online setting. Taught by blind instructors, nine blind learners having a wide range of professional backgrounds participated in a two-week summer course. We describe the course design, teaching strategies, and learning outcomes. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities of teaching data science and visualization to blind students. Our work contributes to the growing body of knowledge on accessible data science and visualization education, and provides insights into the design of online courses for blind students.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates new data exploration experiences that enable blind users to interact with statistical data visualizations---bar plots, heat maps, box plots, and scatter plots---leveraging multimodal data representations. In addition to sonification and textual descriptions that are commonly employed by existing accessible visualizations, our MAIDR (multimodal access and interactive data representation) system incorporates two additional modalities (braille and review) that offer complementary benefits. It also provides blind users with the autonomy and control to interactively access and understand data visualizations. In a user study involving 11 blind participants, we found the MAIDR system facilitated the accurate interpretation of statistical visualizations. Participants exhibited a range of strategies in combining multiple modalities, influenced by their past interactions and experiences with data visualizations. This work accentuates the overlooked potential of combining refreshable tactile representation with other modalities and elevates the discussion on the importance of user autonomy when designing accessible data visualizations.},

  abstract = {The usage of identity- (e.g., ``disabled people'') versus person-first language (e.g., ``people with disabilities'') to refer to disabled people has been an active and ongoing discussion. However, it remains unclear which semantic language should be used, especially for different disability categories within the overall demographics of disabled people. To gather and examine the language preferences of disabled people, we surveyed 519 disabled people from 23 countries. Our results show that 49\% of disabled people preferred identity-first language whereas 33\% preferred person-first language and 18\% had no preference. Additionally, we explore the intra-sectionality and intersectionality of disability categories, gender identifications, age groups, and countries on language preferences, finding that language preferences vary within and across each of these factors. Our qualitative assessment of the survey responses shows that disabled people may have multiple or no preferences. To make our survey data publicly available, we created an interactive and accessible live web platform, enabling users to perform intersectional exploration of language preferences. In a secondary investigation, using part-of-speech (POS) tagging, we analyzed the abstracts of 11,536 publications at ACM ASSETS (N=1,564) and ACM CHI (N=9,972), assessing their adoption of identity- and person-first language. We present the results from our analysis and offer recommendations for authors and researchers in choosing the appropriate language to refer to disabled people.},
