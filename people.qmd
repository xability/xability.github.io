<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text">Dr. JooYoung Seo leads the (x)Ability Design Lab, where their research focuses on accessibility research. He is an assistant professor in the School of Information Sciences and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Computer Science, Informatics Institute, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Seo is also an RStudio double-certified data science instructor and accessibility expert certified by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). His research topics involve accessible computing, universal design, inclusive data science, and equitable healthcare technologies. As an emerging learning scientist and information scientist, his research focuses particularly on how to make computational literacy more accessible to people with dis/abilities by using multimodal data representation.

He has worked on various research and development projects on accessible computing and open-source data science packages (e.g., gt; shiny; rmarkdown to name a few) for accessibility. His research projects have involved not just web accessibility, but also human-centered design and development studies, including inclusive makerspaces, tangible block-based programming, accessible data science (e.g., data tactualization, sonification, and verbalization), and accessible/reproducible scientific writing tools for people with and without dis/abilities.

His research is funded by national institutes, industrial partners, and academic society, such as Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR), Posit Software, PBC (formerly RStudio), Teach Access, and the International Society of the Learning Sciences (ISLS) and the Wallace Foundation.

Seo obtained his PhD and M.Ed in  at the Pennsylvania State University, and double BA in education and English literature from Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, South Korea.</p>

<h3 class="card-title">Sanchita Kamath</h3>
<h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted">Ph.D. Candidate, Information Sciences</h6>
</div>
<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text">Sanchita Kamath is a Ph.D. candidate in Information Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction, Data Visualization Education, and Embodied Learning. Her research explores how generative AI and immersive technologies can make data experiences more inclusive, non-visual, tangible, and human-centered. At the (x)Ability Lab, Sanchita designs and evaluates multimodal and embodied interfaces that bridge cognitive and physical engagement in data understanding. Her projects include VR-based learning environments, AI-driven visualization tools, and interactive pedagogical frameworks that reimagine how data can be felt, explored, and understood beyond sight. Her broader goal is to advance accessible data education by merging design, technology, and embodied experience to create equitable pathways for learning and exploration.</p>

<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text">Aziz is a data-driven human-computer interaction researcher working at the intersection of orientation and mobility, artificial intelligence, and assistive technology. His current work focuses on utilizing multimodal AI models to provide an accessible and interactive application for the spatial orientation of blind and visually impaired (BVI) travelers. He is actively exploring opportunities to leverage data and the lived experiences of BVI individuals to facilitate safer and more efficient technologically interdependent travel experiences.</p>

<h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted">Ph.D. Candidate, Computer Science</h6>
</div>
<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text">Omar is a human-computer interaction researcher working at the intersection of accessibility, human-AI interaction, and inclusive STEM education. His current research focuses on co-designing accessible data visualizations, especially qualitative or 'open-ended' data such as concept maps, network graphs, and coding trees, with the blind and low-vision (BLV) community. Through understanding BLV researchers' workflows and processes, he aims to create responsible, AI-driven digital experiences that empower people of diverse abilities to independently create, interpret, and share complex information with their peers and broader audiences.</p>

<h6 class="card-subtitle text-muted">Ph.D. Student, Information Science</h6>
</div>
<div class="card-body">
<p class="card-text">Weijun Zhang is a researcher focusing on accessibility, human-computer interaction (HCI), and universal design in both educational and workplace settings. Blind since birth, he combines lived experience with academic inquiry to explore how emerging technologies can support inclusive design and improve digital accessibility for people with disabilities.
Before joining the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Weijun earned a master’s degree in Translation and Interpreting from Beijing International Studies University and another in Cultural Foundations of Education from Syracuse University. In addition to his academic work, he has been actively involved in disability rights advocacy in China for many years. His interdisciplinary background and advocacy experience inform his current research on accessible computing, inclusion in education and Employment, and the development of digital tools that empower people with visual impairments.</p>
